Oh, I cannot explain, every time, it's the Hackthron
Oh, I feel that it's coding, take my heart
I've been coding too long, oh, I can't be so strong
Take the chance for Sunning, take my heart

I need you so
There's no time I'll ever go

coding, coding lady
Goin' through a Next JS
Love is where you find it
Listen to your heart

coding, coding lady
Living in coding
It's always like the first time
Let me take a part

coding, coding lady
Like there's no tomorrow
Take your coding, don't lose it
Listen to your heart

I get up, I get down, all my world turns around
Who is right? Who was wrong? I don't know
I've got pain in my heart, got a coding in my soul
Easy come, but I think easy go
I need you so
All the times I move so slow

coding, coding lady
Goin' through a Next JS
Love is where you find it
Listen to your heart

coding, coding lady
Living in coding
It's always like the first time
Let me take a part

coding, coding lady
Like there's no tomorrow
Take your coding, don't lose it
Listen to your heart
