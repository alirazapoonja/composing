🎵💻 Turning Song Lyrics into Code – A 2-Year Learning Journey

a Lyric Adaptation & Creative Rewriting website, where popular song lyrics are rewritten in programming language style. 15 songs (100 songs lyrics)

As part of my programming language learning journey, I use creative lyric composition as a learning aid to explain programming concepts.
By rewriting technical topics such as classes, modules, methods, and theoretical foundations into song lyrics, I am able to better understand and retain complex ideas.

I am truly grateful to my teachers and institute for providing the guidance, encouragement, and learning environment that allow me to explore innovative ways of understanding programming. Their support has played an important role in my learning journey.

This method integrates music with structured technical education, supporting both creativity and conceptual clarity.

The idea was simple:
 👉 make programming concepts easier to understand
 👉 blend creativity with code
 👉 learn TypeScript in a fun, practical way

I’m now sharing this project with GIAIC students to show that learning code doesn’t always have to be serious — sometimes music makes concepts stick better 🎶💡

Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
